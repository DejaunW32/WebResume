        <p> 
            This project was created as part of the QuickStart
            winter internship partnered with the  Department of Energy
            throught METIL labs. I created a QR code Activated based VR Simulation
            in order to give employees "hands on" training with pnuematic systems
            in which equipment can be altered and have to option to be view in 
            an exploded view point
